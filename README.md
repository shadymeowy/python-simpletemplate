# python-simpletemplate
SimpleTemplate class extracted from bottlepy and stripped

Just perfect for simple applications.
Most dependencies and Python 2 support are stripped.
It does not check for template files, so it can work in more obscure environments.
It is tested with both CPython, PyPy and Brython.
